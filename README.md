A simple application to toggle the DTR pin for Push to Talk.  Most implementations are press to talk, press to stop. This will only be on while spacebar is pressed.

Compile in Visual Studio 2012 (not sure if it will in other versions).

Current code is packaged as a release.  You can click on "release" above, and download the compiled code.
